# What is the purpose of this PyNet repo?

To not be mistaken with the actuall PyNet repo, this repo is a collection of my notes and exercises of computer
Networks implemented in python. The purpose of this repo is to help me understand the concepts of computer networks
and develop my python skills.

# What Python modules are used for networks

## Socket Module
Socket Module
The socket module in Python provides a way of using the Berkeley sockets API. It is a low-level module for network communication and provides the building blocks for most of the high-level modules in Python for network communication. The socket module provides an interface to the TCP/IP protocol.  The socket module provides the socket class and a number of related functions and constants. The socket class provides a way of communicating over networks using the BSD socket interface. It supports both TCP (stream) sockets and UDP (datagram) sockets, as well as raw sockets, and allows the use of select/poll-type multiplexing and asynchronous I/O.
