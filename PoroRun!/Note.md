This code is not mine. It was made by the guy from the Clear Code youtube channel.
--->here is the link: https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk

From it i learned how to use the PyGame library, and learned some example of OOP.

But it is important to note that i do plan to do some customization here and there. and change the art to the Poro from the infamous leaugue of legend game, hence the name PoroRuner.

Mainly i am waiting for my friend to give me the needed artwork of pixel poro.
