# What is the purpose of this program?
This Program serves as a way to automate a part of my part-time job where i need to calculate how many item i have sold, which follow a certain algorithm. simple nothing secial really. I was bored at work thought i do somthing fun.

# Point To Improve on the code

1. **User Interface Enhancements:**
   - Add more user-friendly prompts and instructions to guide the user through the process.
   - Consider creating a menu-based interface where users can choose different options (e.g., add sale, view summaries, exit) to enhance usability.

2. **Data Validation:**
   - Implement data validation for user inputs. For example, ensure that the quantities entered are positive, and handle cases where the user enters invalid items.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Improve error handling by providing clear error messages when incorrect inputs are provided. For example, if the user enters an invalid item name, provide a message explaining the valid options.

4. **Sales Reporting:**
   - Implement a function to generate sales reports over different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly).
   - Add visualization options, like generating graphs or charts to visualize sales trends over time.

5. **Code Modularity:**
   - Consider breaking down your code into smaller functions that have specific responsibilities. This will make your code easier to read, test, and maintain.

6. **Data Persistence:**
   - Instead of asking for the initial amount of money in the case every time the program runs, you could store this information in a separate configuration file or database.

7. **Input Validation:**
   - Implement validation for the "Choose currency" input to ensure the user only enters "dollars" or "lbp".

8. **Currency Handling:**
   - Implement a more comprehensive currency handling system. Right now, you're converting between currencies and adding to `total_lbp` without subtracting anything when using LBP. Consider tracking both "money_in" and "money_out" for LBP and dollars separately.

9. **Summary Enhancements:**
   - Instead of hardcoding the item summaries, you could dynamically generate summaries based on the items present in your sales data dictionary.

10. **Documentation and Comments:**
    - Add inline comments to explain complex logic or sections of your code.
    - Consider adding a docstring at the beginning of your program to explain its purpose and how to use it.

11. **Code Formatting:**
    - Ensure consistent code formatting to enhance readability.

12. **User-Friendly Outputs:**
    - Improve the formatting of the outputs to make them more visually appealing and easier to understand.

13. **Backup and Version Control:**
    - Consider implementing a backup system to save previous versions of your sales data file. Additionally, using version control (like Git) can help you track changes and collaborate more effectively.

Remember that these are just suggestions, and you can tailor them to your specific needs and programming goals. Each enhancement can add complexity to your program, so prioritize based on what will provide the most value to your use case.
