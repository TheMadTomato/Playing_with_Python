The code in this folder "tkapp" is by no means my code. It is the code of a lovely youtube girl whom i enjoy content. Her channel is called Python Simplified, and this is the link to video i used to learn from https://youtu.be/itRLRfuL_PQ.

Many thanks for making content that helped me understand Tkinter lib.
