# Playing_with_Python
 Here is store most of my python code from day one. Plus it's where i store my random python projects. While some of them is not yet ccomplete i will make sure to document what is missing..


Fun Algorithm --> contains codes where i explored certain algorithm like fizzbuzz & fibonacci.

GPA Calculator --> My first Python project where i made an interactive GPA calc for Uni.

PoroRun! --> A yet to be completed project where i create a flappyBird-like game using pygame.

Random code --> nothing special, just pracitce code that i still had laying around.

Simple games --> as the name suggest, simple CLI games

tkapp --> A pdf reader GUI where i learned how to use tkinter.
